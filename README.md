#**Task and bug tracking system**

Login page is half-ready now.

#### Developed with

Java 14, JavaFX 15, MySQL 8


#### How to

1) Download **Java**.

2) Download **IntelliJ**.

3) Download **JavaFX**. 
Here is a tutorial https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html#add-javafx-lib .

4) Download  **MySQL**. Don't forget 
about **Java Driver**,
so you can connect to database.

5) Download **SceneBuilder** 
which is a drag and drop UI designer tool
that generates FXML.

6) Add src folder to libraries in Project Structure...
(that helped to fix problem "TaskTrackingApp module is not found").

7) Create a MySQL server. Then create a database called dbts. I used DataGrips with student licension.

8) Install a plugin **Database Navigator** in IntelliJ. 
Use the plugin to connect with database. 
In class DatabaseConnection edit database name, 
url, user, password.
